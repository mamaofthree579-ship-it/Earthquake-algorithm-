# Contributing to IHRAS

- Open issues for feature requests and bugs.
- Keep API keys out of the repo; use environment variables or secrets.
- Follow the code of conduct and keep changes small and well-documented.
- Use `black`/`flake8` style checks before submitting PRs.

Simple workflow:
1. Fork repo, create feature branch.
2. Add tests (where relevant).
3. Open PR with description & link to related issues.
